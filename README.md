# cDFT_tutorial
## Description
This page offers several user-friendly code for one who is interested in learning classical density functional theory (cDFT). The convergence procedure is also visualized to help one understand how the solution is reached via Picard iterations.

## Supported case
cDFT_JCE_LJ: Calculation of the one dimensional density profile with 
Lennard-Jones attraction at the origin (r=0).<br>


## Update log
02/25/2019
Code at the ideal limit is removed and python code and visualization is available for cDFT_JCE_LJ case.<br>

This repository now contains matlab scirpts for the simple system without consideration of excess term of free energy. For more details on the physics, the following reference is recommended to check: *Introduction to Classical Density Functional Theory by a Computational Experiment* (DOI: [10.1021/ed500049m](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ed500049m)).<br>
cDFT_JCE_ideal demostrates how to calculate the one dimensional density profile at the ideal limit.<br>
cDFT_JCE_LJ demonstrates how to calculate the one dimensional density profile with Lennard-Jones attraction at the origin (r=0).<br>
